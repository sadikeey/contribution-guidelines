# Contribution Guidlines

### Getting Started

To get started, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Create a new branch for your changes using the naming convention specified in the repository's README.md file
3. Make your changes and commit them with a clear and descriptive message (see below for commit message guidelines)
4. Push your changes to your forked repository
5. Open a pull request with a clear description of your changes

### Branch Naming Convention

When creating a new branch, please use one of the following naming conventions:

- `feat/<branch-name>` for new feature development
- `bug/<branch-name>` for bug fixes
- `hotfix/<branch-name>` for critical bug fixes
- `refactor/<branch-name>` for code refactoring
- `docs/<branch-name>` for documentation updates

### Commit Message Guidelines

Please follow these guidelines when writing commit messages:

- Use imperative mood in the commit message (e.g. "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").
- Start the commit message with a verb in lowercase, such as "add", "fix", "update", "remove", "refactor", "docs", etc.
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Add a brief summary of the changes in the blank line after the first line, if necessary.
- Be specific and descriptive about the changes made in the commit.
- Reference related issues or pull requests using the syntax "Fixes #<issue-number>".

#### Examples of Good Commit Messages

fix: Corrected spelling errors in login page
bug: Resolved issue with data not being saved to database
chore: Update dependencies to latest versions

```

### Other Guidelines

- When making a pull request, provide a clear description of the changes you've made.
- If your pull request fixes an issue, reference the issue in the pull request description using the syntax "Fixes #<issue-number>". For example, "Fixes #42".
- Be respectful and professional in your interactions with other contributors.
